This folder represents the sequences of solutions' states for different problems.
The problems to solve are SICP book exercises.
Main purpose to demonstrate the solving problem process as a sequence of connected solving states in time.
Main idea that software (as product of problem solving) actually evolves and does it gradually.
The evolution actor (the subject which proccesses the evolution) is a programmer's brain.
The environment circumstances to evolve for are problems' requirements.
In theory there are no bad solutions, if they are working, but in practice the latest solution is preferable. So there is a hidden temporal requirement.
